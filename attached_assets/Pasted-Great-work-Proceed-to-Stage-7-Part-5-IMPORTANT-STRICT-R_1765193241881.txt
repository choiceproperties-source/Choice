Great work. Proceed to **Stage 7 Part 5**.

IMPORTANT – STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT modify any dashboards (Renter, Owner, Agent, Buyer).
- Do NOT modify backend, API routes, database, or any server files.
- Do NOT refactor or change any existing components except adding the new review form.
- Only create NEW review form components and integrate them into the property-details page.
- All review submission is client-side ONLY (local state merged with mock reviews).
- Do NOT alter the existing 7 mock reviews. New submissions should append on top.

------------------------------------------------
STAGE 7 — PART 5: “WRITE A REVIEW” + STAR RATING INPUT (CLIENT-SIDE ONLY)

Goal:
Add a modern, clean “Write a Review” form to the property details page that lets a user submit a review (client-side only). Submissions should feel real and merge with the existing mock review list.

Deliver ONLY the following:

1. NEW HOOK — useSubmitReview.ts
   - Maintains local submittedReviews state.
   - New reviews append to the top of the list.
   - Fields required:
        • name
        • rating (1–5)
        • comment
        • date (string: new Date().toISOString())
        • avatarInitial (auto: first letter of name)
   - Returns:
        • submittedReviews
        • submitReview(reviewData)
   - No backend calls. No database changes.

2. NEW COMPONENT — StarRatingInput
   - Users tap/click to select 1–5 stars.
   - Hover animation on desktop.
   - Mobile-friendly tap zones.
   - Props:
        • value (number)
        • onChange(newValue)
   - Style must match ReviewStars but be interactive.
   - data-testids:
        • star-input-${1..5}

3. NEW COMPONENT — ReviewForm
   - Collect:
        • Name input (text)
        • StarRatingInput
        • Comment textarea (2–4 sentence recommended limit)
   - Validate:
        • name required
        • rating required
        • comment min ~8 words
   - Includes:
        • Cancel button (resets form)
        • Submit button (disabled until valid)
        • Toast message on success: “Review submitted!”
   - Full dark mode support.
   - Smooth transitions.
   - data-testid="form-review"

4. Expand ReviewsSection (but DO NOT modify existing review logic):
   - Add a new “Write a Review” box ABOVE the list of reviews.
   - This box includes:
        • Header: “Write a Review”
        • ReviewForm component (collapsible)
   - Collapsible behavior:
        • Default state: collapsed with button “Write a Review”
        • When expanded → shows form
   - Styling should match other sections.

5. Integrate Local + Mock Reviews Together
   - In ReviewsSection:
        reviewsDisplayed = [...submittedReviews, ...mockReviews]
   - New reviews appear at the top.
   - When empty: still show the mock empty state properly.

6. DO NOT modify:
   - usePropertyReviews.ts
   - review-stars.tsx
   - review-card.tsx
   - NearbyPlaces, MapSection, PropertyOverview, PhotoGallery
   - ANY dashboard files.
