YOU ARE WORKING ON THE GITHUB REPO: [INSERT YOUR REPO LINK HERE].
THIS IS AN UPGRADE — NOT A REBUILD.
YOUR GOAL: Add Rently-style registration, roles, property listings, and rental applications WITHOUT BREAKING EXISTING APP.

==============================
ABSOLUTE SAFETY RULES
==============================

- DO NOT delete any existing files
- DO NOT rename routes, components, or APIs
- DO NOT change frameworks or libraries
- DO NOT rewrite existing authentication
- DO NOT refactor working code
- DO NOT change existing UI styles globally
- ONLY add new logic where required
- IF UNSURE → STOP AND REPORT

==============================
STEP 1: READ-ONLY ANALYSIS
==============================

Analyze the repo WITHOUT changing anything:
- Detect frontend framework
- Detect backend framework
- Detect authentication system
- Detect database system
- Locate user model
- Locate dashboards
- Locate routing structure

Do NOT modify any code yet.

==============================
STEP 2: USER ROLES (SAFE EXTENSION)
==============================

Extend the existing user system by adding a `role` field.

Roles:
- tenant
- landlord
- agent

Rules:
- Existing users MUST continue working
- Default role = tenant
- Role field MUST be optional for backward compatibility

Example:
role?: "tenant" | "landlord" | "agent"

Update signup flow to include role selection, redirect to role-based dashboards, without breaking current users.

==============================
STEP 3: ROLE-BASED ACCESS (ADD ONLY)
==============================

- Tenants: browse properties, apply, track applications
- Landlords: create/manage properties, review applications
- Agents: manage assigned properties, communicate with tenants

Do NOT block existing routes unless strictly necessary for security.

==============================
STEP 4: PROPERTY LISTING SYSTEM (ISOLATED)
==============================

Add a new property module:

Property fields:
- title
- address
- city
- state
- zip
- price
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- amenities
- images
- availabilityDate
- landlordId
- agentId (optional)
- status (draft | published)

Rules:
- Only landlords & agents manage listings
- Only published listings are public
- Must NOT interfere with existing repo data

==============================
STEP 5: PROPERTY BROWSING (TENANTS)
==============================

Add new pages:
- /properties
- /properties/:id

Navigation:
Home → Browse Properties → Property Details

Do NOT replace homepage or existing navigation.

==============================
STEP 6: RENTAL APPLICATION SYSTEM
==============================

Add a separate application module:

Application fields:
- tenantId
- propertyId
- landlordId
- agentId (optional)
- status
- documents
- submittedAt

Status flow:
submitted → under_review → info_requested → approved → rejected

Rules:
- Tenants see ONLY their applications
- Landlords/Agents see ONLY relevant applications

==============================
STEP 7: MESSAGING (SAFE ADD-ON)
==============================

Add basic in-app messaging:
- Linked to property or application
- Stored securely
- No real-time required unless already supported

==============================
STEP 8: SECURITY (MINIMUM, NON-BREAKING)
==============================

Implement:
- Role checks
- Ownership checks
- Route protection
- Secure uploads

If conflicts arise → STOP and report.

==============================
STEP 9: FINAL VERIFICATION
==============================

Confirm:
- App runs correctly
- Existing features unchanged
- No broken routes
- No console errors

==============================
FINAL REPORT (MANDATORY)
==============================

Output:
1. New files created
2. Existing files modified
3. Features added
4. Confirmation:

"Existing app functionality remains unchanged."
