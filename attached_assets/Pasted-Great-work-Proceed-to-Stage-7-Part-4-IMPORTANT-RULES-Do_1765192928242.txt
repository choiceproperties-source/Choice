- Do NOT refactor any existing components.
- Only modify property-details.tsx and NEW review-related components.
- Keep everything client-side only.
- Do NOT touch PhotoGallery, PropertyOverview, AmenitiesGrid, MapSection, or NearbyPlaces.

STAGE 7 — PART 4: REVIEWS + RATINGS (CLIENT-SIDE ONLY, REALISTIC MOCK DATA)

Goal:
Add a modern Reviews & Ratings section to the property-details page using HIGH-QUALITY, REALISTIC mock reviews (not fake-looking placeholders).

DELIVER ONLY THE FOLLOWING:

1. NEW HOOK: usePropertyReviews.ts
   - Returns:
       • averageRating (calculate from reviews)
       • totalReviews
       • reviews array
   - Each review object must include:
       • id
       • name (realistic names, e.g., “Sarah M.”, “Jonathan K.”)
       • rating (1–5, varied)
       • date (formatted, within last 2 years)
       • comment (authentic, 2–4 sentences, human-sounding)
       • avatarInitial: first letter of name
   - Use a static dataset of 3–7 reviews that SOUND real:
       • Example themes:
           - “Great location, quiet neighbors”
           - “Maintenance response was quick”
           - “Had issues with parking, but overall good”
           - “Very clean and spacious, matched photos”
       • Mix of positive + slightly critical reviews
       • Keep it trustworthy and believable
   - Must be deterministic (same data every time).

2. NEW COMPONENT: ReviewStars
   - 1–5 stars display (filled + outlined).
   - Used globally for rating displays.
   - Add data-testid attributes.

3. NEW COMPONENT: ReviewCard
   - Includes:
       • Avatar circle with initial
       • Name + date
       • ReviewStars for rating
       • Comments
   - Subtle hover elevation
   - Dark mode styling
   - data-testid attributes for all key parts

4. NEW COMPONENT: ReviewsSection
   - Section Header: “Reviews & Ratings”
   - Rating Summary:
       • Large average rating (e.g., “4.6”)
       • ReviewStars below it
       • Total reviews (“Based on X reviews”)
   - Review list:
       • Vertical stack
       • Use ReviewCard for each
       • Responsive spacing
   - Empty state if no reviews:
       “No reviews available for this property.”
   - Full dark mode support
   - Smooth transitions (200–300ms)
   - data-testid="section-reviews"

5. Integration inside property-details.tsx
   - Add ReviewsSection BELOW the NearbyPlaces component.
   - Keep spacing + layout consistent with earlier sections.
   - Do NOT modify any other sections.

6. DO NOT add review submission functionality yet.
   - This will be Stage 7 Part 5.

STOP after completing Part 4 and show me the output.
