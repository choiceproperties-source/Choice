Pls I want u to keep my website’s original texts. The about is. Services and every other thing but update the site using the information below:

1. PROPERTY PAGE STRUCTURE — Zillow Design
Make A good property page that ALWAYS has the same order.

📸 1) Hero Gallery (take over the top of the screen)

This is like the billboard at the entrance of the plaza.
Big photos, swipeable, clickable, fullscreen.

🏷️ 2) Quick Summary (price, beds, baths, address)

People want the basics fast.
In the industry this is called the “decision surface.”

🧱 3) Property Facts + Features

This is the architectural structure of the page.
You list things like:
	•	square feet
	•	year built
	•	type
	•	heating
	•	cooling
	•	parking

📝 4) Description Section

One long paragraph or two short ones.

🗺️ 5) Map Section

Zillow, Opendoor, Redfin — all put the map mid-page.
It grounds the listing in the real world.

🧑‍💼 6) Owner/Agent Box

Very important, app will have multiple agents.
Shows:
	•	profile photo
	•	name/company
	•	verification badge
	•	contact button
	•	maybe phone/email

🏘️ 7) Nearby Homes or Similar Listings


📸 2. PHOTO GALLERY 
I want exactly what makes Zillow/Rently/OpenDoor feel amazing:

🚍 A) One giant hero photo at the top

Not small.
Not cropped.
A full-width, huge image.

🚍 B) Swipe left/right on mobile

Smooth, fast, no lag.

🚍 C) Click = fullscreen mode

Darkened background, thumbnails below, arrow buttons.

🚍 D) Thumbnails below the main photo

Tiny previews help users jump ahead.

🚍 E) Preloaded images

Don’t make the user wait.
Good apps load next/previous images quietly in the background.

🚍 F) Consistent size

No jumping.
Every image should appear smoothly.


3. SUPABASE DATA STRUCTURE (make it simple)
Create a simple backend for 
	•	property records
. business registrations (owners/agents)
	•	photos
	•	authentication
	•	permissions


🏛️ Table 1: Owners (Agents / Landlords)

Each owner

Fields:
	•	id
	•	name
	•	profile_photo_url
	•	verified (true/false)
	•	description
	•	contact_email
	•	created_at

Every property will link to this.


🏛️ Table 2: Properties

Each property

Fields:
	•	id
	•	owner_id (foreign key → owners.id)
	•	title
	•	price
	•	bedrooms
	•	bathrooms
	•	type
	•	square_feet
	•	address
	•	city
	•	state
	•	zip
	•	description
	•	created_at

🏛️ Table 3: Property Photos

Fields:
	•	id
	•	property_id
	•	photo_url
	•	created_at

4. PROPERTY UPLOAD FLOW 

Here’s the total experience a landlord should have:

🏁 Step 1 — Login / Register

Supabase Auth handles this.

🏁 Step 2 — Create an Owner Profile

Upload profile photo
Enter business name
Get a verification badge later (admin-only at first)

🏁 Step 3 — Press “Add Property”

Opens a simple form:
	•	title
	•	price
	•	city
	•	bedrooms
	•	bathrooms
	•	type
	•	photos
	•	description

🏁 Step 4 — Upload Photos (to Supabase Storage)

Photos → storage
Storage returns URLs

🏁 Step 5 — Create Property in Database

Send the info + owner_id + photo URLs to Supabase

🏁 Step 6 — Instantly Visible

Because I want  frontend to read directly from Supabase,
the new property should appear immediately.

🧑‍💼 5. OWNER/AGENT PROFILE PAGE

✔ Profile photo

✔ Business name

✔ Verification badge

✔ Contact info

✔ “About” description

✔ All properties they manage (but don’t show it to the public)

This feels like Zillow’s “Agent Profile” pages.

When a user clicks the owner on a property page →
They go to this profile.

How I want this to work

🟦 USER → creates owner profile → stored in Supabase → gets owner_id

🟧 USER → uploads property → property has owner_id attached

🟩 Each property page → fetches property → fetches owner → fetches photos

🟥 Gallery → loads all photos → swipe + fullscreen

🟨 Owner profile page → lists all properties where owner_id matches

🟪 Home page → shows all properties, newest first

⬜ Admin dashboard → toggle verification badges.


1) Identity & Owners — who can post

What the owner/agent model needs to capture (fields / attributes):
	•	id (unique)
	•	name (company/agent)
	•	slug (url-friendly name)
	•	profile_photo_url
	•	email (contact)
	•	phone (optional)
	•	verified (boolean) — controlled by admin
	•	verification_meta (who verified, when, notes)
	•	description / about
	•	address / office location (optional)
	•	created_at / updated_at

UX flow to create an owner:
	•	Sign up or log in (Supabase Auth recommended).
	•	“Create my business” form (name, photo, contact).
	•	Show onboarding steps: complete profile, upload logo, optionally request verification.
	•	Admin receives a verification request (if requested) and can toggle verified = true.
Design notes: let owners have multiple contact methods. Keep the verification toggle manual at first — that increases trust and keeps the process simple.

2) Listings (properties)

Property fields (minimum, clear and extensible):
	•	id
	•	owner_id (foreign key → owners)
	•	title
	•	slug (for url)
	•	price / rent
	•	listing_type (sale / rent)
	•	status (available / pending / leased / sold)
	•	bedrooms / bathrooms / sqft
	•	address / city / state / zip / lat / lng (lat/lng optional for now)
	•	description (long)
	•	features (array: garage, pool, fenced, pet_friendly, etc.)
	•	photos (array of photo URLs)
	•	docs (array: PDF leases, disclosures)
	•	created_at / updated_at

UX notes for property detail page:
	•	Hero gallery, quick facts strip under the gallery, price prominently displayed, owner card on the side, map mid-page, description and features below, similar/nearby listings at the bottom.

Why this schema? It’s simple but covers everything Zillow-like, and lets you add filters/search easily.


3) Media — photos & documents

Storage strategy:
	•	Use Supabase Storage (or local /uploads for now) with directories like:
	•	/owners/{ownerId}/profile.jpg
	•	/properties/{propertyId}/photos/{timestamp}.jpg
	•	/properties/{propertyId}/docs/{docId}.pdf

Best practices:
	•	Limit single image size (e.g., 2–5 MB) and dimensions (max width 4096px) — compress client-side if possible.
	•	Generate multiple sizes / thumbnails (small, medium, large) so gallery loads small images then swaps to larger on demand.
	•	Keep file names unique with propertyId + timestamp.
	•	Store public URLs in the DB for the frontend.

4) Full Application System (forms + admin + lifecycle)
I want a complete application system that behaves as if a screening vendor were integrated. We will simulate the screening steps inside your app so workflow and UX feel professional.

A. Applicant experience (what they see & do)
	1.	Start application — click “Apply” on property page.
	2.	Step 1 — Basic info: name, email, phone, birth date, current address.
	3.	Step 2 — Rental history: previous addresses, landlord contact (optional), reason for leaving.
	4.	Step 3 — Employment & income: employer, position, monthly income, proof (upload paystub pdf/jpg).
	5.	Step 4 — References: personal references contact info.
	6.	Step 5 — Additional disclosures: pets, smoking, criminal history checkbox (with consent text), number of occupants.
	7.	Step 6 — Upload documents: ID (driver’s license photo front/back), paystubs, letters.
	8.	Step 7 — Signature & consent: e-sign checkbox accepts screening terms, data usage, and fee (if you charge).
	9.	Final — Submit: show confirmation and status (Submitted → Pending Screening → Manual Review / Approved / Denied).

UI tips:
	•	Break into pages (wizard) with a clear progress bar.
	•	Save drafts (so applicants can return).
	•	Use clear helper text explaining why you need each doc — builds trust.

B. Backend handling of applications

When an application is submitted, backend should:
	1.	Persist application data to applications table:
	•	id, property_id, applicant_id (if logged in), status, created_at, updated_at.
	2.	Store uploaded docs in storage and save URLs.
	3.	Queue a screening job (internal, simulated) which runs checks and then marks results.
	4.	Notify the property owner(s) & admin by email (and in-app notifications) that an application arrived.

Application table core fields:
	•	id
	•	property_id
	•	applicant_name
	•	applicant_email
	•	applicant_phone
	•	applicant_user_id (optional)
	•	state (draft/submitted/pending/under_review/approved/denied)
	•	screening_score (numeric 0–100)
	•	screening_report (json blob with check results)
	•	documents (array of URLs)
	•	created_at / updated_at

Create a professional mail template that can be sent to applicants after submission and after we’ve approved their application 
. Just mimic realistic things here while the site still don’t run. Credit or identity checks automatically just manual stuff. Approval and denial should be based on manual decisions but keep it professional to the user.  

7) Privacy, legal, and consent (very important)

Because site is handling PII and documents:
	•	Show explicit consent on the application form: explain what data you collect and how it’s used.
	•	Retention policy: only keep personal docs for a limited time (e.g., 90 days) unless needed for legal reasons. Offer admin tools to purge.
	•	Access controls: only owners of a property and admins can view applications for that property.
	•	Logs: keep audit logs for decisions and accesses.
application fees should be picked from the property automatically. 

8) The tools you will need (minimal & practical)
	•	Database & Storage: Supabase (free) — tables described above + storage for media.
	•	Auth: Supabase Auth (email/password, social optional).
	•	Frontend: React (you have this) — form wizard for application, owner pages, gallery.
	•	Backend: optional. You can implement business logic serverless (Supabase Functions) or keep your existing Node server and let it call Supabase. Backend useful for “jobs” (screening pipeline), sending email (use an email provider).
	•	Email provider: SendGrid
