Stage 1: Admin Panel Skeleton & Core Access

Focus: Build a fully functional Admin Panel with role-based access control for managing users, properties, applications, inquiries, saved searches, and analytics. The panel should be modern, mobile-responsive, dark-mode ready, and polished, without modifying existing dashboards or API endpoints.

Tasks:

1. Layout & Navigation:
   • Create /admin route and protected AdminPanel component.
   • Sidebar navigation with sections:
       - Users
       - Properties
       - Applications
       - Inquiries
       - Saved Searches
       - Analytics
   • Top header with admin avatar, notifications, and logout button.
   • Responsive layout (sidebar collapses on mobile, top nav only).
   • Dark mode support.

2. Core Sections Skeleton:
   • Users Section:
       - Table of all users: name, email, role, created date.
       - Filters by role (admin, agent, owner, renter).
       - Search bar.
       - Buttons: View, Edit, Delete.
   • Properties Section:
       - Table of all properties: title, owner, status, price.
       - Filters: active/inactive, location.
       - Buttons: View, Edit, Delete.
   • Applications Section:
       - Table of applications: applicant, property, status, date.
       - Filters: status.
       - Buttons: View, Approve, Reject.
   • Inquiries Section:
       - Table of inquiries: sender, property, status, date.
       - Buttons: View, Respond, Close.
   • Saved Searches Section:
       - Table: user, search filters, created date.
       - Buttons: View, Delete.
   • Analytics Section:
       - Placeholder charts and stats cards: total users, total properties, total applications, inquiries per day.

3. Technical Notes:
   • Use shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide icons.
   • No backend changes, only frontend integration with existing endpoints.
   • Protect route: only users with admin role can access.
   • Include data-testid attributes for automated testing.
   • Smooth transitions, hover effects, and mobile-first design.

Deliverables:
   • AdminPanel.tsx with sidebar navigation and top header.
   • Placeholder sections for Users, Properties, Applications, Inquiries, Saved Searches, Analytics.
   • Fully responsive and dark-mode ready.
   • Ready for incremental feature integration in Stage 2 (CRUD + charts).
