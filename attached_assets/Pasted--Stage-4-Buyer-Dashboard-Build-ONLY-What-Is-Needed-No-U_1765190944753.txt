🚀 Stage 4: Buyer Dashboard — Build ONLY What Is Needed (No Unnecessary Changes)

Hi Replit AI! We’re continuing on a new Replit account. Please implement ONLY the Buyer Dashboard. Do NOT modify any existing code outside of what is required for this dashboard. Leave all other dashboards, endpoints, styles, and components untouched unless absolutely necessary.

🎯 Scope: Buyer Dashboard Only
Create and polish the Buyer Dashboard using the same quality and modern design as the Renter, Owner, and Agent dashboards.

1️⃣ Sections to Implement:
• Wishlist
  - Show all favorited properties using existing favorites hook
  - Allow user to remove favorites
  - Modern property cards (images, beds, baths, price)

• Saved Searches
  - Fetch buyer’s saved searches
  - “View Results” button applies filters
  - Delete saved searches with confirmation

• Market Insights
  - Price trend chart
  - Recommendations based on buyer behavior
  - Tips for buyers

2️⃣ Features & UI Requirements:
• Stats cards (Wishlist count, Saved Searches count, Insights)
• Tab navigation
• Smooth transitions (200–300ms)
• Hover effects
• Mobile-responsive layout
• Full dark mode support
• Loading spinners while fetching data
• Empty states with CTAs
• Toast notifications for user feedback
• Add data-testid attributes to interactive elements

3️⃣ Hooks & API:
Use EXISTING hooks where possible:
• useFavorites
• useSavedSearches
• useMarketInsights (create ONLY if needed)

Use ONLY relevant API endpoints:
• GET /api/favorites/user/:userId
• GET /api/saved-searches/user/:userId
• DELETE /api/saved-searches/:id
• PATCH /api/saved-searches/:id
• Market insights endpoint — ONLY create if not already available

4️⃣ Important Instructions:
🚫 Do NOT modify:
• Other dashboards (Renter, Owner, Agent)
• Existing hooks unless needed for Buyer Dashboard
• Server routes unrelated to Buyer Dashboard
• Styling or components globally
• App.tsx routing structure (only add import + route if missing)

✅ Goal:
Build the Buyer Dashboard ONLY, make it polished, modern, and production-ready — without touching anything outside its scope.

Please proceed in small steps to avoid hitting limits.
